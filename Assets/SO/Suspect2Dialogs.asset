  responses:
  - options:
    - "Rohan asked me to come by after office hours. He said the numbers didn\u2019t
      add up and wanted a private discussion. Things got tense, so I left earlier
      than planned."
    - "I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there at all. Someone must have mistaken my car
      for someone else\u2019s."
    - I only stopped near the entrance to drop off documents. I never went inside
      his office.
  - options:
    - "It was around 10:30 PM. He was still angry, still going through files. I remember
      thinking he wouldn\u2019t leave anytime soon."
    - It must have been close to midnight. I completely lost track of time.
    - I saw him briefly in the evening, nothing more.
  - options:
    - "That lines up with when I was already gone. Whatever happened\u2026 happened
      after me."
    - "That watch was old. It could\u2019ve stopped anytime."
    - "Timepieces fail under stress. It doesn\u2019t prove anything."
  - options:
    - I had no idea about that. No one informed management.
    - Rohan ordered the shutdown himself.
    - That happens almost every night.
  - options:
    - Someone wanted to hide movement. That much is obvious.
    - Rohan edited his own logs.
    - Logs fix themselves sometimes.
  - options:
    - We both drank coffee. It was a long discussion.
    - "I don\u2019t drink coffee."
    - "That wasn\u2019t my mug."
  - options:
    - "If that report surfaced, I\u2019d lose everything. That\u2019s not something
      I\u2019m proud of."
    - It was harmless.
    - I never saw it.
  - options:
    - Driving home. I remember stopping at a signal.
    - Still arguing with Rohan.
    - Standing in the lobby.
  - options:
    - He was showing it to someone. I saw the pages myself.
    - He always left it open.
    - Someone staged that.
  - options:
    - "I walked away. I didn\u2019t want things to escalate."
    - We resolved it calmly.
    - Meera interrupted us.
