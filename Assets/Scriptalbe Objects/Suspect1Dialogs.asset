  responses:
  - options:
    - "It was a routine patrol, nothing unusual at first. The warehouse is quiet
      at night, but that\u2019s normal. I was just doing my job."
    - "I was assigned to a different sector that night. Warehouse 13 wasn\u2019t
      even on my route."
    - I was filling in paperwork at the security office all evening.
  - options:
    - It was close to eleven. He looked distracted, barely acknowledged me. Like
      his mind was somewhere else.
    - "I saw him around nine. After that, I didn\u2019t cross paths with him."
    - "I didn\u2019t see him at all that night."
  - options:
    - That was during my patrol window. I remember checking the corridor clock around
      then.
    - "Cameras were down long before that. The timing doesn\u2019t matter."
    - "I wasn\u2019t even on duty at that hour."
  - options:

    - "I didn\u2019t touch those logs. That\u2019s not my department."
    - Editing logs is part of my duty.
    - "I honestly don\u2019t remember."
  - options:
    - "I never touched it. I don\u2019t drink on patrol."
    - Everyone used that mug.
    - It was already there.
  - options:
    - "He questioned my reports more than once. Said something didn\u2019t add up."
    - "I didn\u2019t know about any audit."
    - That was above my role.
  - options:
    - Near the control room. Filling out the incident log.
    - Outside smoking.
    - On my break.
  - options:
    - I never touched that ledger.
    - Aarav had it earlier.
    - Kabir was carrying it.
  - options:
    - "I heard raised voices. It didn\u2019t sound friendly."
    - Everything was calm.
    - No argument happened.
